To get relative imports to work, you must run this while in the directory before dataTether:

set PYTHONPATH=%CD% 

or for a more comprehensive command from the root dir of this repo:

`set PYTHONPATH=%CD% && python ./dataTether/app/server.py`

NOTE: You must enable keyspace events on the redis db:
`CONFIG SET notify-keyspace-events KEA`
