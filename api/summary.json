[[90, 92, [["Top Management Attention", "Conventional wisdom takes a skeptical view of the role of top managers in the innovation process, often characterizing them as either irrelevant or impediments; at best, they may have a positive, but indirect, influence on innovation. However, the results of a 10-year study of more than 700 new product teams show that successful new product development efforts had senior managers who either were intimately involved with virtually every aspect of the process or made it clear that they completely backed the project. Top management attention positively drives innovation, especially when CEOs exhibit a future focus and an external focus (outside the firm). This allows the firm to move quickly to detect and respond to new technologies and opportunities."], ["Creative Destruction", "Firms must recognize that products in high-tech environments typically sustain only a finite spell at the technological frontier before being made obsolete by better products. Given this reality, a firm should not be too enamored with the technology that forms the basis of its initial success, but instead strive to develop even better, next-generation technologies\u2014despite the fact that such developments may alienate some current customers, make obsolete its sunk investments in the prior technology, and render any economies of scale and experience curve advantages useless. If it doesn\u2019t, its rivals surely will. This paradoxical model of competition is known as creative destruction."], ["Managers' Willingness to Cannibalize", "Companies that engage in creative destruction are characterized by a culture in which managers are fearful of obsolescence and willing to cannibalize their own successful products. Factors such as strong autonomous strategic business units competing internally for resources; strong product champion roles; and focus on future markets more than on current markets can make managers more inclined to cannibalize their own successful products."], ["Product Champions", "Product champions\u2014integral to the successful development of many breakthrough innovations\u2014are people who create, define or adopt a new idea and are willing to assume significant risk to make it happen.

Product champions wield substantially more influence in innovating firms than non-innovative firms."], ["Skunk Works", "To create an innovative climate conducive to thinking out of the box, companies set up skunk works\u2014new venture teams that are isolated or removed from normal corporate operations. The rationale is that when large established companies develop new innovations they do so despite corporate systems not because of them. Examples include IBM's PC group in Boca Raton Florida and Toys 'R' Us online operations set up separately from corporate headquarters."]]], [92, 94, [["Skunk Works", "A corporate strategy to create an innovative climate by setting up new venture teams that are isolated from normal corporate operations.
