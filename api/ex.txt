{"0": "The Civil War   \nThe American Civil War  (1861 \u20131865 ) most notably  ended  slavery and formed the United S tates.  In New \nMexico, two bloody  battles  at Valverde  and Glorieta  are attributed to keeping Confederate forces from \nexpanding west . Hundreds more lives  were lost when Civil War soldier s forced thousands of Navajo on \nthe Long Walk to Bosque Redondo. Horrific stories of tragedy and loss from this period of time have not \nfaded for the Din\u00e9  or Navajo people .  \nHistory of Conflict  \nIn the southwest, s ignificant and often  traumatic events in history  have been etched in rocks, burned \ninto hearts , ingrained int o minds , and handed down orally , generation -to-generation , for hundreds of \nyears.  Starting  in the late 1600s  through the 1700s, a historical pattern of raiding and  friendly  trading \nexisted among  the Navajo, Spanish, Hispano, Mexican, Apache, Comanche, and Ute.  \n \nDuring the early 1800s , Navajo groups residing along the New Mexico and Arizona border were battling \nseveral bands of Indians, Spanish settlers, Anglo settlers,  Mexican and U.S. governmental forces  over \ngrazing lands . In January 1804, Navajo warriors attack ed and raided the town of Cebolleta  in an attempt \nto reclaim grazing land. The following year, Spanish troops retaliated , killing 115 Navajos and enslaving \n33 women and children , at Canyon de Chelly.  The photo below is a petroglyph panel located in Canyon \nde Chelly  that a rchaeologists believe  is possibly a Navajo depiction of the punitive expedition by the \nSpanish  that occur red in 1805.  \nMilitary History New Mexico -Battles: http://drarchaeology.com/culthist/historic/battles.htm  \nIn March  1822 , twenty -four Navajo leaders , who had been traveling to meet with the New Mexican \ngovernment  for a peace conference , were kille d in a massacre at Jemez Pueblo.  Mistrust and hostilities  \nbetween the groups  led to a battle against a Mexican expedition in the Chuska Mountains , where \nNavajo chief Narbona  defeated  Captain Blas de Hinojos \u2019 expedition in February 1829 . This battle is \nreferred to as , The Battle of Copper Pass , or Beesh Lichii'I Bigiizh  in the Navajo language , and the site is \nalso known as Narbona Pass.  \nIndian Policy  \nExtraction of natural resources (mining)  and western expansion  for new Anglo populations  were factors \nthat led to policy changes within the  United States government toward Indians. On May 26, 1830 t he \n", "1": "Indian Removal Act  was signed into law by President Andrew Jackson ; a policy  that called for voluntary \nrelocation  of Native American tribes living east of the Mississippi River to lands west of the river . The \noutcome of this policy resulted in the  forceful signing of treaties  and abrupt relocation of Native \nAmerican people from traditional homelands to reservation lands .  \n \nIn 1835, the Treaty of New Echota  was signed , which resulted in the r emoval of the Cherokee  people  in \na historic event  known as  The Trail of Tears . The Cherokees experienced hunger, disease and exhaustion \non the forced march ; over 4,000 out of 15,000 died  on the journey . Many tribes such as the  Seminoles , \nas well as fugitive slaves , resisted removal  and did not leave peacefully  from their traditional homelands . \nFrom 1835 \u2013 1842 , an estimated 3,000 Seminoles and American soldiers were killed as a r esult of the \nIndian Removal Act.  \nBy the 1840s , Navajos were livi ng in scattered bands  throughout and beyond the traditional Navajo \nhomeland, Din\u00e9tah . Their homeland included land within the borders of the four sacred mountains ; an \nexpanse that extended from northeastern Arizona through western New Mexico  into southern Colorado \nand Utah.  In areas such as  Canyon de Chelly , there were  many traditional homes , corn fields, fruit \norchards  and Navajos raised sheep  for the purpose of using wool to weave  clothing  and blankets,  and \nfor sustenance . Many of the Navajo were considered wealthy if they possessed  a large  sheep stock.  \nRaids and counter -raids of livestock between the Army, the Navajo , and civilian militia greatly intensified  \nduring the 1840s , and slave raids were the cause of much of the violence in the Southwest. In 1844, t he \nMartinez Treaty  was signed at Jemez Pueblo , which required  Navajos to return their slaves , but did not \nrequire the same concession from New Mexicans. At the time , an estimated  75 percent of the three to \nsix thousand slaves in New Mexico were  Navajo . \nTrail of Treaties  (1846 \u2013 1863 ) \nThe year  1848  marked a turning point in history  as the California Gold Rush  began, the Mexican -\nAmerican War  (1846 \u20131848) ended with the ratification of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo . The U.S. \nnow own ed 1.36 million km\u00b2 (525,000 square miles)  of areas t hat were ceded  by Mexico , which included \nparts of present -day Arizona, California, New Mexico, Texas, Colorado, Nevada, and Utah. According to \nthe treaty, Mexico relinquished all claims to Texas , and recognized the Rio Grande as the southern \nboundary with the United States. Those residing within the annexed areas had the choice of relocating \nwithin Mexico's new boundaries , or receiving  American citizenship  with full  civil rights.  Navajo  and \nApache  homelands  were also part of the ceded areas;  thus U.S. military leaders began peace talks and \nnegotiations with Hispano land grant communities , and Native Americans in an effort to increase \ncommerce and new settlements for Anglo populations.  \n \nOn August 31, 1849 , Navajo leader Narbona , along with se veral hundred of his warriors , met with a \ndelegation led  by Col. John M. Washin gton to discuss terms for peace. After the peace council ended \nand member s started to  depart, a  New Mexican officer claimed that a horse , being ridden  by one of the \nNavajo warriors,  belonged to him. Col. Washin gton , now  put in the position of backing one of his \ntroopers, demanded  that the horse be immediately turned over. When the  Navajo warrior refused and \nthe horse and its rider departed , Washington commanded his troops to prepare to fire if th e Navajo ", "2": "refused to return the now claimed stolen  horse . After  the Navaj o warrior  again denied the request  to \nreturn the horse , a cannon and some rifles were fired, which mortally  wounded  Narbona in the assault . \nAccording to eyewitnesses, Narbona was scalped by one of the New Mexico militiamen . \nOn March 12, 1851 Governor James S. Calhoun iss ued a proclamation that called for an accurate census \nor enumeration of all inhabitants (except Indians).  According to the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo , \n\u201cproperty of every kind now belonging to Mexicans not established there shall be inviolably \nrespected.\u201d  Therefore , every resident in New Mexico that was under Mexican rule  and chose to stay \nwithin the now US boundaries , would have right s to land and property.  Pueblo land grants that were \ngiven by the Spanish empire , and had been respected under t he Mexican government , were also \nacknowledge d by the treaty . Despite Governor Calhoun\u2019s proclamation, every resident should have \nbeen counted by the census of 1851 , as a New Mexico citizen  \u2014 including  Indians.  \nThe Apache and the Navajo were not the only t ribes raiding or attacking in New Mexico. Many tribes \nwere mobile and extremely independent; their only political authorities  were within small bands and not \ncoordinated under a central unified leadership , therefore t he actions and behaviors of some small \ngroups were not a reflection of the entire population. During  the 1840s and 1850s , Mexican forces \ndevoted military resources to protecting the eastern part of New Mexico which was under attacks by the  \nComanche,  Kiowa  and Kiowa -Apache , and  they continued to operate against Apache bands as late as \n1915.  \nOn March 18, 1851 Governor C alhoun\u2019s second proclamation , \u201cauthorized the attack on any hostile tribe \nof Indians that may have entered settlements for the purpose of plunder and depredation\u2026and directed \nor ordered residents to capture the property from any hostile tribe of Indians\u201d. Pueblo leaders , \nHispano s, and Anglo  settlers  demanded protection  by the United States from Navajo  and Apache  \nraiding.  In response , the U.S. government established military forts with in the traditional Navajo \nhomeland s, erecting  Fort Defiance  and Fort Wingate  in August 1851.   \nBy the mid -1850\u2019s , the \u2018Gold Boom\u2019 of the California Gol d Rush was in decline. Prospectors turned their \neyes to new mining camps near army posts in Arizona , with farmers and ranchers shortly following suit. \nTensions between miners and the Apache in southern Arizona and New Mexico surmounted. Many \npeaceful bands  of the Apache were attacked by the Mesilla Guard ; a militia unit organized to fight the \nMescalero and Chiricahua Apache , as well as  other  Indian bands thought to be raiding along the Rio \nGrande.  \nMost of the men that comprised the volunteer military milit ias were  from the Pueblos of  Santo  \nDomingo, Zuni, Oribe, and Santa Clara . Spanish  and Hispano  descendants who lived in settlements , \nestablished by Spain during  the 17th century in northern New Mexico , also enlisted in militias . Some of \nthe r easons why men deserted from  military campaigns during this time  were that they  needed to tend \ntheir fields, help harvest crops, or return to help their family . Men found guilty of crimes were hung in \npublic squares; many hung in the plaza of Santa Fe after court pro ceedings. Most h angings were for \ncrimes such as theft  of mules to travel, stealing , and killing livestock for food.  "}
